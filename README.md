Analysis


The analysis in this project involved exploring the data, identifying patterns, and drawing insights. The following tasks were performed:



Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data accuracy and consistency
Descriptive Statistics to identify areas of improvement.
Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of employees across different departments, regions, and education levels.
Visualization of the distribution of employees across different departments, regions, and education levels.
Predicting future performance using linear regresion
Identification of factors that contribute to employees' performance rating.
Visualization of the distribution of employees' age and the relationship between age and length of service.



Conclusion


The insights drawn from the analysis provide valuable information to aid in decision-making regarding employee management. The analysis shows that the company's employee demographics are diverse, with employees distributed across different departments, regions, and education levels. Female employees have a slightly lower average training score than male employees, suggesting a possible gender gap in training opportunities. The analysis also indicates that employees' performance rating is influenced by factors such as age, length of service, and the number of training programs attended.



Overall, this project highlights the importance of data analytics in making informed decisions regarding employee management. By analyzing HR data, organizations can identify areas that require improvement and develop strategies to retain and attract talent.
